        Thoughts:
        Symmetry seems to play a big part. Some observations are: each person must show up to the same number of meetings.
        N - 1 must divide 2 * [number of meetings a person show up to] so that a person can equally pair with all other people.
        Obviously, the total number of meetings * 3 = N * [number of meetings a person show up to].

        Aside from that, I couldn't figure out much about this problem.
