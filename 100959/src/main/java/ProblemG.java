        Thoughts: operation order doesn't seem to matter, so might as well sort the operations and do the larger
        ones first. A simpler problem to consider might be if the operations are neither adjacent nor overlap.

        I don't have much more thought on this problem. I felt like in general I'm having a difficult time with
        combinatorial problems, maybe because I'm yet to understand its principles well.
