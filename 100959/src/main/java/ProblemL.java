        Thoughts:
        Essentially, we're able to insert a string after a character in S as long as the string satisfies:
        1. head of the string is not equal to the character we're appending after
        2. the string does not have two adjacent identical characters.

        We can first think about how to solve this problem without the restriction.

        It seems that we can solve this problem by modifying the Levenshtein distance algorithm to account for the
        new insertion rule.
